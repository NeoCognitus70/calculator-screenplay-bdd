# Calculator Screenplay BDD — Backlog

**Version:** 2 — Risk #1 resolved via strategy (c): preflight check + README quick-start + ADR 0001
**Last Updated:** 2026-06-12
**Based on:** survey of the repo at commit `16deca9` (README, SCREENPLAY.md, package scripts, PR #1)

This backlog tracks outstanding work and risks for the calculator Screenplay/BDD demo project,
ordered by priority score (highest first). It is the project's **source of truth** for item
status — session handovers narrate; this file records.

**Priority Scoring System:**
- **Score = Security Impact (0–10) + Breakage Probability (0–10) + Maintenance Burden (0–10)**
- **HIGH (20–30):** Critical — immediate action required
- **MEDIUM (10–19):** Important — schedule within current sprint cycle
- **LOW (0–9):** Desirable — schedule when capacity allows

## Outstanding Risks

None outstanding.

### Resolved Risks

Resolved risks are kept here as a record that the gap existed — do not delete them.

#### Risk #1: Hard dependency on a sibling checkout of `hand-baked-screenplay-pattern` ✅ Resolved 2026-06-12

**Priority Score was:** Security Impact (0) + Breakage Probability (6) + Maintenance Burden (4) = **10 points** (MEDIUM)
**Resolution:** Strategy (c), user-confirmed — the `file:../` sibling convention is kept
deliberately for this co-developed teaching pair. Added
`scripts/preflight-screenplay.mjs`, run before `prepare:screenplay` (sibling present?) and before
`verify` (sibling present and built?), failing fast with the exact clone remedy; promoted the
sibling requirement into the README quick-start ("clone both, side by side"); recorded the
decision and its revisit trigger (external consumers ⇒ pinned git dependency with a tagged
release) in
[`docs/adr/0001-consume-screenplay-library-via-sibling-checkout.md`](./adr/0001-consume-screenplay-library-via-sibling-checkout.md).
Actual effort: ~1 hr.

**Success Criteria:**
- [x] A documented, reproducible path from `git clone` to a green `npm run verify` (README
  Prerequisites/Install: clone both repos side by side, `prepare:screenplay`, `install`, `verify`)
- [x] The dependency is explicitly documented with a preflight check that fails with a clear
  error message when the sibling is missing
- [x] Decision recorded (ADR 0001)
**See:** PR introducing the change (worklist branch `worklist/sibling-dependency-and-ci`).

## Potential Next Steps

### MEDIUM Priority

1. **Add `CHANGELOG.md`** — ~1 hr, NOT STARTED. The portfolio layout contract recommends one; the
   sibling `hand-baked-screenplay-pattern` project has an established example to follow.

### LOW Priority

1. **Expand `docs/`** — the only doc beyond the README is
   `docs/screenplay-flow-through-the-sut.md`; consider a short architecture note covering the
   playwright-bdd project structure (`features/`, `src/`, `tests/`, the unit-and-api vs bdd
   Playwright projects).

## Maintenance Notes

- Include links/paths to affected files when adding new items.
- Update the version number at the top when items change status.
- Cross-reference code review findings in `.review/` once a review exists.
- Mark completion dates when items move to ✅ Resolved.
- Update effort estimates with actuals after completion.
